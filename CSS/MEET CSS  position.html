<h2>Happy Holi</h2>

<p>Holi is a major Hindu festival of India, celebrated in the Hindu calendar month of Phalgun. The festival lasts for one night and one day, beginning on a Purnima (full moon day) in Phalgun. It usually corresponds to March month of the Gregorian calendar. Holi is a festival of joy and love and is fervently celebrated in the Indian sub-continent, especially in India and Nepal. It is also called festival of colours, as people take to streets and play with colours. Unlike most Hindu festivals, Holi doesnâ€™t involve veneration of any of Hindu Gods or Goddesses and is thus purely celebrated for fun. Though, the night before Holi, a ritual of Holika Dahan is carried out, in which people burn their discarded belongings in a bonfire.</p>
